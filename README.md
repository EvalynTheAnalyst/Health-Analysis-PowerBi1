# Health Data Analysis Dashboard
## INTRODUCTION ##
This project presents a **comprehensive health data analysis** derived from a dataset of 10,000 patients. The interactive Power BI dashboard provides insights into key health indicators such as **BMI, weight, height, age group, and gender**. The goal is to identify patterns and distributions across various BMI categories to better understand the population's overall health trends.
